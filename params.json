License: GNU GPL v3 \r\n\r\nRight now its capable of the following:  \r\n* find authors and add them to the database  \r\n* list all books of an author and add them as 'wanted'.  \r\n* LazyLibrarian will search a nzb-file for that book (only Newznab and nzbmatrix are currently supported)  \r\n* If a nzb is found it will be send to sabnzbd or saved in a blackhole where your downloadapp can pick it up.  \r\n* When processing the downloaded books it will save a coverpicture (if available) and save all metadata into metadata.opf next to the bookfile (calibre compatible format)\r\n* The new theme for the site allows it to be accessed (and usable) from devices with a smaller screen (such as an iPad)\r\n\r\n##Screenshots\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/4sQDZ.png\" width=\"600\">\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fr0yE.png\" width=\"600\">\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AOgh1.png\" width=\"600\">\r\n\r\n## Install:  \r\nLazyLibrarian runs by default on port 8082 at http://hostname:8082/home\r\n\r\nLinux / Mac OS X:\r\n\r\n* Install Python 2.6 or higher  \r\n* Git clone/extract LL wherever you like  \r\n* Run \"python LazyLibrarian.py -daemon\" to start in deamon mode  \r\n* Set your username & password in the settings if you want.  \r\n* Fill in all the config fields","name":"Lazylibrarian"}
